Kidney Stone Prediction
This project aims to predict whether a patient is likely to have a kidney stone or not based on various medical features such as age, gender, blood pressure, etc. We will be exploring the dataset, performing some exploratory data analysis, and building 7 machine learning models to predict the outcome.

# Dataset Description
The dataset is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains information about 400 patients who have been diagnosed with kidney stones. The dataset consists of 11 features including age, gender, blood pressure, serum creatinine, etc. The target variable is binary, indicating whether the patient has a kidney stone or not.

# Importing Libraries & Data
We will be using pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn libraries in this project. The dataset is in a CSV format, and we will use pandas to read the data.

# Data Loading
We will load the dataset using pandas and perform some initial exploratory data analysis. We will check for missing values, outliers, and any other issues with the dataset.

# Summary of our Datasets
We will perform some statistical analysis to get a summary of our datasets. We will look at the distribution of features and target variable.

# EDA
We will perform some exploratory data analysis to gain some insights about the dataset. We will visualize the data and try to identify patterns in the data.

# Model Building and Evaluation
We will build 7 machine learning models to predict the outcome. The models we will be building are:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Support Vector Machine
K-Nearest Neighbors
Naive Bayes
We will evaluate the models using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC score. We will also perform cross-validation to get a better estimate of the model's performance.

We will then select the best model and use it to make predictions on the test set. Finally, we will create a submission file for Kaggle.

# Conclusion
In this project, we explored the kidney stone dataset and built 7 machine learning models to predict the outcome. We evaluated the models using various evaluation metrics and selected the best model for predictions. This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict the outcome of a medical condition based on various medical features.
